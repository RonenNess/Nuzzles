# Nuzzles

Nuzzles is a web puzzles game for kids, completely clean of annoying ads and other distractions.
It's designed for desktop and mobile devices (note: recommended to use fullscreen mode so your kid won't accidentally exit page).

## Features

- Choose pieces count.
- Select one of the built-in images, or upload your own.
- Show / hide background.
- Choose snapping strength.

## About

I made this small project as a gift for my 3 yo daughter. 

The code is licensed with GPL so feel free to clone and make your own variations of it.
Note: it was done very quickly and barely designed, so you might want to tidy up a little.
